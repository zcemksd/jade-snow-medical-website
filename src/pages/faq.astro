          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-gray-200">About Our Models</h2>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How realistic are the models?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Our models are derived from real patient MRI and CT scans, preserving individual anatomical 
                variations. They offer realistic tactile feedback for drilling, cutting, and handling, 
                validated by neurosurgeons for training use. Surgeons report 92% satisfaction and 9+/10 
                usability scores.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can models be customised for specific cases?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Yes. We create patient-specific models from provided MRI/CT scans (DICOM format). 
                We can replicate tumours, vascular abnormalities, fractures, and other pathologies. 
                Typical turnaround is 2-3 weeks from scan to delivery.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What procedures can be practiced with these models?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Current models support: EVD insertion, foramen magnum decompression, craniotomy/craniectomy, 
                burr hole placement, skull base approaches, and temporal bone drilling. We are continuously 
                developing models for additional neurosurgical procedures.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can models be reused?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Models are designed for single-use training to maintain anatomical realism. However, 
                for institutions requiring multiple training sessions, we offer bulk pricing and regular 
                delivery schedules.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-gray-200">Training & Education</h2>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Do you run training courses?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                We partner with hospitals and training centres to supply models for their courses. 
                We do not directly deliver surgical training, but work closely with course organisers 
                to ensure models meet educational objectives. We have supported 10+ courses at leading 
                institutions including UCLH National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.

            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Are the models suitable for resident training programmes?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Absolutely. Our models are used extensively in neurosurgical residency programmes 
                for procedural skills development. They allow residents to practice rare or high-risk 
                procedures safely and repeatedly, building muscle memory before operating on patients.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can models be used for patient education?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Yes. Patient-specific models help surgeons explain procedures to patients and families, 
                improving informed consent. Some institutions use models to demonstrate planned surgical 
                approaches and expected outcomes.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-gray-200">Ethics & Sustainability</h2>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Why use 3D-printed models instead of cadavers?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Cadaveric training faces ethical, logistical, and cost challenges. Our models provide 
                a repeatable, consistent, and ethical alternative. Trainees can practice the same procedure 
                multiple times without cadaver scarcity constraints. Models are available year-round, 
                require no special storage, and avoid religious or cultural concerns.

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How does the decentralised network reduce environmental impact?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Our production nodes in London, Zurich, and Taiwan enable local manufacturing close to 
                end users. This reduces shipping distances, carbon emissions, and delivery times. 
                Digital files are transferred securely, and only the final physical model is shipped.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What happens to patient data used for custom models?</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                All patient data is anonymised before processing. We handle DICOM files according to 
                data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA-compliant workflows available). Original scans 
                are not stored after model creation unless explicitly requested for research partnerships.
